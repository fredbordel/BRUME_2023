    m_Localized: "On a certain planet somewhere, in a plain and ordinary town, ravaging
      fires threaten to wipe out all forms of life.\nHaving evacuated, the town\u2019s
      inhabitants have left behind all of their belongings.\nThe only hope in preserving
      their stories: Brume, a small cloud made of water.\nA kind and generous soul,
      Brume was sent on a mission to tame the fires.\nKnowing nothing about the former
      inhabitants, every object they come across is a clue pointing to the cause
      of this human catastrophe.\nJust before touching down, Brume asks themself:
      \u201CIf water can be just as much an element of a natural disaster, is fire
      really at the heart of the problem?\u201D"
