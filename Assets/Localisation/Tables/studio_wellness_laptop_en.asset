    m_Localized: "Dear Community,\nI\u2019m dealing with a lot of anxiety this week.
      I started to sort through all of my belongings. The accumulation is distracting
      me from what I really want and what feels good. It\u2019s a vicious cycle where
      these ridiculous objects make me feel awful and I end up buying more, which
      brings on even more stress and frustration. I wanted to throw everything out!\n"

    m_Localized: "But then I came across my good luck charm. I couldn\u2019t go through
      with it. It\u2019s all that\u2019s left of my stuff. It\u2019s a part of me.
      It brings me back to myself \u2013 a compass of sorts. I\u2019m such a contradiction!
      A meditation session is in order.\nStay present and stay focused,\nmindfulgirl
